### README:

    This project was created for institutional purposes. The project consists of creating a simple game using the graphics.py module. Haresh Quiz Game, is a quiz game that consists of 20 questions. You start with three lives, every time you answer a question incorrectly you lose one. If you lose all of your lives it's game over. You win the game if you reach the end without losing all of your lifes,
you win. 
    
    This program uses the graphics.py module from Zelle's Book. The first lines of code of my game are two lists. One list holds all of the question, while the other holds all of the answer, this way is easier to print them in the window since I can just call the list in a specific index, for an specific question. 
    
    I used 10 functions, aside from the main. These are: consoleLikeLook(win), gameLogo(win), instructions(win), pressEnterWhenReady(win), correctAnswer(win), incorrectAnswer(win), lifesExplanation(win), game(win, questionList, answerList, availableLifes), gameOver(win) and     lastly youWon(win). The functions consoleLikeLook(win), gameLogo(win), instructions(win) and lifesExplanation(win) are all functions that contain the design of the game, basically the aesthetics. The pressEnterWhenReady(win) is a function that justs freezes the window until the user enters any key, this function is used multiple times throughout the program. The functions correctAnswer(win) and incorrectAnswer(win) display if you had a correct or incorrect answer. The gameOver(win) and youWon(win) functions display if you won the game or if you lost. Finally, the game(win, questionList, answerList, availableLifes) function holds the algorithm that performs the game.

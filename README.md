    ## Haresh Quiz Game:
    
    <p>This project was created for institutional purposes. The project consists of creating a simple game using the **graphics.py** module. <br>
    _Haresh Quiz Game_ is a quiz game that consists of 20 questions. You start with three lives, every time you answer a question <br>
    incorrectly you lose one. If you lose all of your lives it's game over. If you reach the end without losing all of <br>
    your lifes, you win.</p> 
    
    <p>like previously mentioned in this program we use the graphics.py module from Zelle's Book. The second module imported has two lists; one list holds all of the <br>
    questions, while the other holds all of the answer, this way is easier to print them in the window since I can just call the list in a <br>
    specific index, for an specific question.</p> 
    
    <p>I used 10 functions, aside from the main. These are: <br> 
    - **consoleLikeLook(win)**, - **gameLogo(win)**,  - **instructions(win)**, - **pressEnterWhenReady(win)**,
    - **correctAnswer(win)**, incorrectAnswer(win), lifesExplanation(win), game(win, questionList, answerList, availableLifes), gameOver(win) and 
    lastly youWon(win). The functions consoleLikeLook(win), gameLogo(win), instructions(win) and lifesExplanation(win) are all functions
    that contain the design of the game, basically the aesthetics. The pressEnterWhenReady(win) is a function that justs freezes the window
    until the user enters any key, this function is used multiple times throughout the program. The functions correctAnswer(win) and
    incorrectAnswer(win) display if you had a correct or incorrect answer. The gameOver(win) and youWon(win) functions display if you won
    the game or if you lost. Finally, the game(win, questionList, answerList, availableLifes) function holds the algorithm that performs
    the game.</p>
